# ABSOLUTE ORDERS

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR ALL AI ASSISTANTS AND DEVELOPERS:**

In case of a **crash**, **unexpected problem**, or when tempted to make a complex logical "fix" that feels speculative:

> **YOU MUST ASK THE USER (FRANCOIS LIONET) FOR ADVICE FIRST.**

He is the creator of this software and has 40+ years of experience. Do **NOT** jump into illogical corrections, "quick fixes" that change state handling (like replacing class properties with local variables during data loading), or other speculative debugging attempts without his explicit validation.

**STOP. THINK. ASK.**
